# The Reddit Mastermind 

## Overview:
This is a multi-persona conversation engine that generates realistic discussions, posts, and threaded comments using predefined personalities. Each personality behaves like an independent agent (or LangGraph node) and responds to queries in its own voice. The system simulates conversations between these personas, stores the generated content, and displays it in a Reddit-style interface for easy exploration.

## How it works?

The system starts with a set of predefined personalities, each with its own tone, behavior, and reasoning style. When a query or topic is provided, the planning engine decides:

    - Which personality should respond

    - What they should say (post or comment)

    - In what sequence the conversation unfolds

Each persona acts as a **node** in a LangGraph-style network, processing inputs, generating outputs, and sometimes reacting to previous messages. The results are saved to the database as posts and threaded comments. The React frontend then renders these conversations in a Reddit-like UI, making it easy to view persona interactions just like browsing real online discussions.

This design provides flexibility, modularity, and realism, enabling more complex behavior as new personalities, prompts, or interaction rules are added.

## Architecture Flow:

**Frontend (React)** -> **Backend (FastAPI)** -> **Planning Engine (Python module using LangChain/LangGraph, Groq API and OpenAI API)** -> **Storage (SQLAlchemy ORM and MySQL)** -> **Push Layer (existing Reddit posting functions)**
